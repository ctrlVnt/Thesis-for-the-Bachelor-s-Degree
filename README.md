Bachelor's thesis on the renewal of a platform for calculating the volume of trees to support French forestry operators.

# EmergeMobile

EmergeMobile is the application dedicated to volume calculation operations on trees in the French forest territory. The project involved a renewal of the previous system, which was experiencing malfunctions. We rewrote both the back-end and front-end components from scratch and updated the Android application by addressing bugs and adding new features.

The use of ChatGPT played a crucial role in the project's implementation, providing code, bug interpretation, explanations of technologies, and much more!
